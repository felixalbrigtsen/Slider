# Slider
Simple sliding image puzzle made with P5.JS

Open a live demo HERE, pick a photo and use your arrow keys to play.

Touch/swipe friendly, somewhat adaptive, and fully client-side.
The game allows you to enter any image URL, or use one of the presets at the bottom.
Change the difficulty by splitting the photo into more squares, settings on top of the page.

The shuffle feature mixes up the game, but makes sure it will always be possible to solve it.
